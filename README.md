## Setup
- ðŸ‘¥ The game can be played by two or more people;
- ðŸ“± At least one of the players must have the app installed on the smartphone;
- âš™ When opening the application, you must first enter the names (_in the insert menu_). It can be names of famous people, animals, objects or family members. We suggest that you enter at least 10 names;

## How to play

1. With all the names entered, it's time to play! In the menu, click on 'Play';
2. Choose someone to start. That person will keep the smarthone in hand;
3. The player must place the phone on the forehead, so that all other players can see the smartphone screen, except him;
4. By clicking on the ðŸ”ƒ button, in the lower right corner, the game will draw one of the entered names;
5. The player with the smartphone on his forehead should ask yes or no questions to try to guess "who he is";
6. This round ends when the player hits or folds.
